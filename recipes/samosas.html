        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A samosa is a South Asian fried or baked pastry with a savory filling like
             spiced potatoes, onions, peas, chicken and other meats, or lentils. 
            It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, 
            depending on the region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.
            Samosas are a popular entr√©e, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of South Asia.
             Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas,
             samosas today are often prepared in other regions.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li><small>1/2</small> cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cans garbanzo beans,drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
            <li><small>1/2</small> cup apple juice</li>
            <li>3 sheets frozen puff pastry,thawed</li>
            <li><small>1/4</small> cup all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until browned, 
                about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and add garbanzo beans. Mix curry paste with apple 
                juice until smooth, then add to skillet. Simmer mixture 10 minutes, stirring occasionally
                 and adding more apple juice or water as needed to keep mixture moist.</li>
            <li>Cut each sheet of pastry into 3 equal-size rectangles, then cut each rectangle in half. (You will have 18 pieces total.) Dust a clean, flat surface lightly with flour, and roll each piece of pastry until it is double in size. Dust pastry with flour as needed, to prevent it from sticking to rolling pin. Spoon an equal amount of filling into center of each pastry square. Fold in half and press edges to seal. Place on nonstick baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
